Overview
========

This contains a set of simple scripts for reading, preparing or modifying data related to the iNet dispatch system.

These are dirty scripts for a single particular event but are being kept here for using during that event and for examples for quick scripts at future events.

Most scripts here are likely to be in python but we'll be using whatever we need at the time. Each script is likely to be a self contained file.

If you need to add a script please use some reasonably clear naming convention and try to place scripts for similar problems spaces in a reasonably named subfolder.

Virtual Environment
===================

For consistency sake I'm adding a VagrantFile so you shouldn't have install dependencies locally if you run these scripts. I encourage you to use the Vagrant image for processing.

just:

```
vagrant up
```
